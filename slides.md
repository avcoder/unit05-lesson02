# Recap

- Q: How is an array arranged in memory?
- Q: How might regular characters (ex: "hello") be arranged in memory?
- Q: What's the Big O notation for inserting a new element?
- Q: What's the Big O notation for accessing an element in the array?
- Q: In C, what are the 2 possible values we can output for any variable in memory?
- Q: What was the catch in C when declaring an array?
- Potential issue: What if we wanted to insert an element in the array?
   - Q: List alternative solutions to this issue?


<!--
- char str[] = "Hello";
- char str[] = { 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' };
- Big O = if space not available O(n)
- 2 possible values = address of memory cell, value written in memory cell
- catch = size must be known at compile time.  Can't resize. 
- issue = takes time array to bigger array; can't accidentally overwrite 'h' for 'hello'

# Linked Lists

- We'd like a way to have an array-like structure, but without the downsides of contiguous memory when inserting a new element
<img src="/assets/llist.png">
- Each node contains: 
   - a value (data)
   - a reference (pointer) to the next node
- Q: Does inserting a new element in our list solve the problem we originally had with contiguous memory
- Q: Which is faster: inserting at the beginning of a linked list or an array?
- Q: How might you delete, traverse (loop through and print nodes), or search now?
