# Preview

- Lesson 1 to 4 will be theoritical fundamental concepts about algorithms and data structures
- Lesson 5 to 8 you'll get a development problem, and you'll have to gather resources , research, read and implement a possible solution.  
- See DSA Assignment in LMS
- Brain Teaser: the 8 Golden Weighted Spheres
   - The golden spheres are identical in weight, colour, texture etc... except 1 of the 8 is imperceptibly lighter than the others.  You're given a traditional balance scale?
   - What questions might you ask to clarify problem?
   - What steps would you do to find that odd one out?
   - How many steps would you need to solve it?

# Importance of Algorithms

- You need a way to determine with certainty if the coding instructions you've written to solve a problem is more efficient and scalable over other alternatives
- Examples include:
   - when searching and filtering large data sets
   - managing queues like chat apps, job queues
   - implementing features like autocomplete, recommendation systems, or calendar schedulers
- "But I just ask the DB to filter/search for me so why learn DSA?"
   - You'll still need to understand performance by knowing when a search is efficient
   - Plus you often work with data after the db such as combining multiple data sources in the browser 
 - As you build real-time features, personalized recommendations, analytics dashboards, you move beyond CRUD into an area where efficient algorithms matter

# Importance of Data Structures

1. Different problems require different ways of organizing and accessing data
   - Picking the right data structure makes your app faster and more memory-efficient
2. Improves App performance
   - at first you may be using arrays for filtering a list of thousands, showing recent notifications, sorting large sets etc., but without knowing better structures (ex: tries, heaps, sets), your app can slow down as it grows
   - ex: React's virtual DOM is a tree, Browser rending uses stacks and queues
3. Enables problem solving
   - Data structures provide the foundation you build solutions on top of and are essential to solving algorithmic problems (sorting, searching, pathfinding etc.)
4. Needed for Job Interviews
   - may be asked to solve coding challenges: Big O + choose the right data structure
- Example Data Structures: array, linked list, stack, queue, binary tree, hash table, graph etc.

# How does Computer Memory Work?
You can't have data, without any structure to put it in

# 1. Electricity

- Understand basic electricity (series vs parallel circuits, voltage, current etc.)
   - ex: Switch a light > turns on the light
<img src="/assets/switch.jpg">
- Q: Can we control or manipulate basic electricity?

---
transition: slide-left

# 2. Electronics

- Understand [logic gates / truth tables](https://images.theengineeringprojects.com/image/webp/2023/08/symbols-truth-tables-of-common-logic-gates.jpg.webp?ssl=1)
<img src="/assets/truth.jpg" width="500">
- Q: Now that we can manipulate electricity, can we use electronic components to remember (on/off)?

---
transition: slide-left

# 3. Electronic Memory

- Imagine a room where a light switch turns on a fan. Once the fan is running, it blows on a switch that keeps itself turned on. That’s the feedback loop — once activated, the circuit maintains itself.
- Understand electronics (controlling and manipulating electricity using components)   
   - Watch 30 sec of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0-izyq6q5s#t=0m35s
   - So there is an electronic way to remember state (on/off) 
   - Continue watching until 2:30 to learn more about logic gates
   - Q: if 1 represents `on`, and 0 represents `off`: 
      - How many numeral possibilities can we represent with only one `bit`?  
      - How about with two `bits`?
- Q: Now that we can get electronics to remember state (on/off), can we represent numbers with it?

# 4. Binary

<img src="/assets/binary1.jpg" width="500">

- 8 bits = 1 byte
- What's the maximum number 1 byte can hold?
   - Does that max value remind you of anything?  (hint: [hexadecimal](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*xngYaMqb1JL6PaTb8NXDpA.jpeg))
   - What if we wanted to hold bigger numbers? (see: [data types in C](https://fastbitlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Figure-1.png))
- Now that can represent numbers with 8 bits, can we represent letters?

# 5. Computer Memory
Storage space in a computer where data and instructions are stored

- According to Moore's Law, we should be able to double our electronics component will double in capacity each year
- Q: What does computer memory look like today?
   - Watch 1 minute of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J7X7aZvMXQ#t=0m43s
   - Watch 2 minutes of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J7X7aZvMXQ#t=12m09sdram
<img src="/assets/dram.png" width="300">
- We now have a physical understanding of memory where data (and data structures) can reside
- `Addresses` are used to identify a particular memory block where data resides

# Exercise: Visualizing Memory
Given the following memory cell with its address and its corresponding char

| Address | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| 1000    | A     |
| 1001    | a     |
| 1002    | Z    |

- Q: What binary value is stored at address 1000?
- Q: If an integer takes 4 bytes and starts at address 1010, what are the addresses it occupies?

# Exercise: Visualizing Memory in C

```c
// hello.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello world\n");

  char a = 'A';
  char b = 'a';
  char c = 'Z';
  printf("size of %zu\n", sizeof(a)); // output how many bytes this data type uses
  printf("Address is: %p\n", &a); // output the hexadecimal memory address
  printf("which in decimal is %lu\n", (unsigned long)(uintptr_t)&a); // convert address to decimal

  return 0;
}
```

- to compile run `gcc hello.c` which produces an executable named `a.out`; run `./a.out`
- fyi - did you know if statements can be converted using logic gates?
- try changing data type from `char` to `int` or some other data type
- FYI: Run `otool -tV a.out` to see how code turns into assembly / bytes

# Data Structures Overview

- Data structures are organized ways of storing, managing, and accessing data in a computer so it can be used efficiently. They define the layout and behavior of data in memory and provide methods to add, remove, search, or modify data

- Data structures are containers that hold data in a particular format, tailored for specific kinds of operations or problems

- The right data structure makes your program faster and less resource-intensive

# Data Structures: Arrays

- Q: How might an array be naturally arranged in memory blocks?
- Q: Given the following declaration, how might you locate/arrange this array in memory?
  ```c
  int main() {
    int numbers[3] = {10, 20, 30};
    return 0;
  }
  ```

- Q: Given numbers array above, and base address = 2000, what is the address of `array[2]`
- Q: In C we have to declare arrays with a predefined length - why?
- Q: How would you make a string?
- Q: What issues might you encounter when trying to insert a new element? 
- Q: Compare C with JS: dynamic size (push/pop)? length? type flexibility? methods (map/filter)? memory mgmt?

<!--
- contiguous
- char str[] = "Hello"; OR
- char str[6] = { 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' };

# JS vs C array comparison

| Feature          | JavaScript                 | C                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Dynamic size     | ✅ Yes (`.push`, `.pop`)    | ❌ No (manual memory)      |
| `.length`        | ✅ Built-in                 | ❌ Must calculate manually |
| Type flexibility | ✅ Mixed types allowed      | ❌ Fixed type              |
| Methods          | ✅ Rich (filter, sort, slice etc.) | ❌ Manual code needed      |
| Memory layout    | ❌ Abstracted from you      | ✅ You manage it           |

- Given the above, do you think JS arrays are really an array?
   - `const people = [] // no predefined size`
   - `const mixedArray = [42, "hello", true] // various length in bytes for each type`

# Big O Notation

- "Big O" Notation: Big O is a way to categorize your algorithm's time or memory requirements based on input.  It is meant to generalize growth of your algorithm.

# Time Complexity

- Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows relative to the size of its input. It gives you a way to estimate how fast or slow your code will run as the input gets larger
- It’s expressed using Big O notation which focuses on the growth rate, not exact seconds or milliseconds

| Complexity   | Description      | Example Use Case                     |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `O(1)`       | Constant time    | Accessing an array element: `arr[5]` |
| `O(log n)`   | Logarithmic time | Binary search                        |
| `O(n)`       | Linear time      | Loop through array                   |
| `O(n log n)` | Log-linear       | Efficient sorts (merge, quick sort)  |
| `O(n²)`      | Quadratic        | Nested loops (e.g., bubble sort)     |


---
transition: slide-left
---

# Space Complexity

- Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. - It includes both:
   - Input space – memory needed to store the input (often not counted separately)
   - Auxiliary space – extra memory used by the algorithm to solve the problem 

| Code Example                             | Space Complexity | Explanation                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `int x = 5;`                             | `O(1)`           | Constant space for one variable |
| `int arr[n];`                            | `O(n)`           | Array grows with input size     |
| Recursive function with depth `n`        | `O(n)`           | Call stack takes linear space   |
| Two nested loops that use `n x n` matrix | `O(n²)`          | Storing a 2D matrix             |

# Algorithm: Sorting
A sorting algorithm arranges elements in a particular order (ascending/descending).

- Sorting is crucial for:
   - Searching quickly (ex: binary search)
   - Data organization (ex: showing search results)
   - Optimizing performance in many systems (ex: databases)

- What algorithm might you use to sort this array of numbers: https://excalidraw.com/ 
  - think Golden Spheres challenge
<img src="/assets/unsorted.png" width="400">
- Unlike human eyes/intelligence, what is the only way a computer can "see" an array element's value?

---
transition: slide-left
---

# Bubble Sort

- Try the following sorting algorithm by hand on excalidraw:
```js
// pseudocode
repeat array.length times:
   for each pair of adjacent elements:
      if left > right:
         swap them
```

- Q: After each loop, what "bubbles" to the end of the array?
- Q: When I swapped elements, I had to move the image to another spot -- what's the equivalent in code?
- Exercise: Turn above pseudocode into actual JS code
- Q: What is Big O for bubble sort in terms of time?
   - look for the loops
   - `(n-1) x (n-1) = ??`
- Q: What is Big O for bubble sort in terms of space?
   - Does it require extra memory that grows with the size of the input?
