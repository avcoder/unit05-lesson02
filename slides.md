# Recap

- Q: What is Big O notation?
- Q: How is an array arranged in memory?
- Q: How might regular characters (ex: "hello") be arranged in memory?
- Q: What's the Big O notation for accessing an element in the array?
- Q: What's the Big O notation for inserting a new element?
- Q: What's the Big O notation for deleting a new element?
- Q: Are arrays growable?
- Q: In C, what are the 2 possible values we can output for any variable in memory?
   - in JS, how can we access the value of a variable?
   - in JS, how can we access the address of a variable?
- Q: What was the catch in C when declaring an array?
   - Potential issue: What if we wanted to insert an element in the array?
   - Q: List alternative solutions to this issue?


<!--
- char str[] = "Hello";
- char str[] = { 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' };
- Big O = if space not available O(n)
- 2 possible values = address of memory cell, value written in memory cell
- in JS you cannot access the memory address of a variable directly.
- catch = size must be known at compile time.  Can't resize. 
- issue = takes time array to bigger array; can't accidentally overwrite 'h' for 'hello'

# Data Structure: Linked Lists 
Can we solve the problem of copying an entire array to a new location in memory when inserting?

<img src="/assets/llist.png">

- Each node contains: 
   - a value (data, whose value can be anything. ex: int)
   - a reference (pointer) to the next node (whose value is the address of the next node in memory)
- Q: Does inserting a new element in our list solve the problem we originally had with contiguous memory
- Q: What is the Big O notation for inserting/deleting a new element at the beginning of a linked list?
- Q: What is the Big O notation for inserting/deleting a new element at the end of a linked list?
   - How might we do better for inserting/deleting at end?
- Q: What is the Big O notation for accessing an element in a linked list?

<!--
- O(1) for inserting a new element at beginning of a linked list
- O(n) for inserting a new element at end of a linked list
- Unless you have tail node then it's O(1) for inserting at end
- O(n) for accessing an element in a linked list since you must traverse
